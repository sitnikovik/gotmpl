## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- `make check` now calls the valid `coverage` target instead of the non-existing `coverage-check` target.

### Added

- Go Guard reusable workflow was added to check for the presence of `go.mod`.
- Integration tests were added to the default `make test` flow.

### Fixed

- CI test workflow was corrected to run the proper coverage target.
- Set correct patterns in all files to be replaced with `make setup`
so that is why any file is not changed on the command called

### Changed

- Tests and Quality workflows now require Go Guard to run first and skip Go-specific jobs when `go.mod` is missing.
